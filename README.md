# themarkup-blacklight-browser-analysis

The goal of this project is to design and build the Blacklight tool (https://themarkup.org/series/blacklight) integrating different rendering engines such as Webkit (for Safari) and Gecko (for Firefox) to test each browserâ€™s performance metrics (e.g. execution time, resource usage) and privacy assessment results when using the tool.

We will also analyze the collected performance and privacy assessment data using statistical methods to identify patterns or significant differences among the three browsers which use different rendering engines (Chrome-Blink vs. Safari-Webkit vs. Firefox-Gecko).
